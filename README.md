 The user performs a query through his invocative name (Nickname), where it will be analyzed by the system if the user is in game or not, also performs the search of the players that are in that game, each user will appear in the system with his name and the link that player is currently playing. If the user clicks on any player, basic player information will be displayed as: (How many matches in total, how many matches the player won and how many matches the player lost and also the last 5 matches that the player performed with some match data). This allows any player to analyze the profile of the opponents and his team, so the player can be aware of who he is playing, whether he is a good player or a player without much experience.
